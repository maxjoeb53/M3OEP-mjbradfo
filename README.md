#### Project Overview
This is the first adventure in _Ultimate Mapmaker_, a fantasy RPG where you journey through the expansive Surrounding Continents, treacherously beautiful lands flooded with flora, fauan, friends, foes, and more. 
As a daring cartographer, you assemble a like-minded party to fulfill your dreams of putting a portrait to the most
elusive creatures and dashed quill marks to the most unreachable areas.
You'll use a magical aperture to capture photos, 
camp with your team, sketch, fight monsters, decipher 
logograms, complete mazes, and learn about the rich natural landscape of the innermost Surrounding Continent, Erothos.

I'll be using Python to display images with code from Image_Manip and C++ for the framework of the game.
